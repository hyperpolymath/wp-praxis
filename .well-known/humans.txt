/* SITE */

Project Name: WP Praxis
Purpose: Symbolic Workflow System for WordPress
Languages: Rust, Elixir, TypeScript, PHP, PowerShell, LFE, Racket, SQL
Standards: AGPL-3.0, RSR Bronze, RFC 9116, WCAG 2.1 AA (UI)
Components: 12 (Engine, Injector, Swarm, Parser, DB, GraphQL, Dashboard, Plugin, Introspection)
Software: VS Code, Git, GitHub Actions, Docker

/* TECHNOLOGY */

Backend:
  - Rust (wp_injector) - High-performance symbolic injection
  - Elixir/Ecto (Core/db-schema) - State management
  - TypeScript/Bun (SymbolicEngine/swarm) - Distributed execution
  - PHP (plugin, engine/php) - WordPress integration
  - PowerShell (SymbolicEngine/core) - Symbolic orchestration
  - LFE (Core/manifest-parser) - Manifest parsing with Lisp macros
  - Racket (Core/introspection) - Recursive introspection

Frontend:

Built with ❤️ by the WP Praxis community
Polyglot architecture designed for semantic integrity
Symbolic reasoning meets WordPress automation

/* RSR COMPLIANCE */

Rhodium Standard Repository: Bronze (In Progress)
  - ✅ Type Safety: Rust, TypeScript strict, Elixir specs
  - ✅ Memory Safety: Rust ownership model
  - ⚠️  Offline-First: Partial (database dependencies)
  - ✅ Documentation: Complete (20+ docs)
  - ✅ .well-known/: security.txt, ai.txt, humans.txt
  - ✅ Build System: justfile, flake.nix, GitHub Actions
  - ✅ Tests: 245+ passing (100% pass rate)
  - ✅ TPCF: Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox)

/* PHILOSOPHY */

Core Principles:
  1. Symbolic Dispatching - Route by semantic tags
  2. Preservation of Meaning - Maintain semantic traceability
  3. User Empowerment - Declarative configuration

Design Values:
  - Polyglot Architecture: Each language for its strengths
  - Semantic Integrity: Meaning preserved across layers
  - Developer Empowerment: Complex workflows, simple config
  - Emotional Safety: Reversibility and experimentation
  - Open Development: AGPL copyleft, transparent process

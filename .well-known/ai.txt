✅ Documentation generation from code
✅ Academic research with proper attribution
✅ Open source model training with disclosed datasets

## Prohibited Uses

❌ Training proprietary models without source disclosure
❌ Commercial model training without AGPL compliance
❌ Using code to train models that generate proprietary code
❌ Scraping for closed-source LLMs without attribution

## Attribution Requirements

When using WP Praxis code for AI training:

1. **Cite the Project**:
   - Name: WP Praxis
   - Repository: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/wp-praxis
   - License: GNU AGPL-3.0

2. **Disclose Training Data**:
   - If WP Praxis is part of training data, list it in dataset documentation
   - Include commit hash or release version used

3. **Respect License**:

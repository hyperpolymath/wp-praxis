# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Examples of Behavior that Contributes to a Positive Environment

- ✅ Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- ✅ Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- ✅ Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- ✅ Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- ✅ Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- ✅ Using welcoming and inclusive language
- ✅ Assuming good intent
- ✅ Showing patience with beginners

### Examples of Unacceptable Behavior

- ❌ The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- ❌ Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- ❌ Public or private harassment
- ❌ Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- ❌ Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- ❌ Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests
- ❌ Sustained disruption of community events or discussions

## Emotional Safety & Reversibility

WP Praxis prioritizes **emotional safety** for contributors, especially those learning or experimenting.

### Reversibility First

- **All contributions are reversible** - PRs can be reverted, branches deleted, experiments abandoned
- **Safe to experiment** - Test branches welcome, "failed" experiments are learning opportunities
- **No permanent consequences** - No contribution permanently damages your reputation
- **Undo culture** - Git history is there to help, not shame

### Anxiety Reduction

- **Ask "dumb" questions** - There are no dumb questions, only documentation we haven't written yet
- **Make mistakes openly** - Mistakes are how we learn; share them so others can learn too
- **Work in public** - Draft PRs, work-in-progress commits, and incomplete ideas are all welcome
- **No gatekeeping** - Knowledge should be shared freely, not hoarded
- **Patience with process** - Learning multi-language development takes time

### For Reviewers

- **Critique code, not people** - Focus on the contribution, not the contributor
- **Explain the "why"** - Don't just say what's wrong, explain why and how to improve
- **Celebrate effort** - Recognize the work involved, even if changes are needed
- **Suggest, don't demand** - Offer alternatives rather than dictating solutions
- **Assume good intent** - Most contributions are earnest attempts to help

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**conduct@wp-praxis.dev**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

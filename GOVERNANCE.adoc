= WP Praxis Governance Model
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== Overview

WP Praxis operates under a *meritocratic governance model* based on the **Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)**.

== Decision-Making Structure

=== Core Team (Perimeter 1)

**Authority**: Final decision on architectural changes, releases, and project direction

**Members**:
* Project Lead (Benevolent Dictator for Life model, temporary)
* Core Maintainers (2+ years of consistent contributions)

**Selection**: Unanimous vote by existing Core Team members

**Responsibilities**:
* Release management
* Security response
* Architectural decisions
* Conflict resolution (final arbiter)

=== Expert Contributors (Perimeter 2)

**Authority**: Domain-specific decisions, code review, mentor new contributors

**Requirements**:
* 50+ merged pull requests OR
* 6+ months of consistent contributions OR
* Recognized expertise in specific domain (formal verification, security, etc.)

**Selection**: Nominated by Core Team or 3+ Expert Contributors, approved by Core Team

**Responsibilities**:
* Code review (binding approval)
* Mentorship of Community Contributors
* RFC shepherding
* Documentation ownership

=== Community Contributors (Perimeter 3)

**Authority**: Submit proposals, contribute code, participate in discussions

**Requirements**:
* Accept Code of Conduct
* Sign Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
* Follow contribution guidelines

**Responsibilities**:
* Submit pull requests
* Report bugs and issues
* Participate in RFC discussions
* Improve documentation

== Decision-Making Process

=== Consensus Model

1. **Proposal**: Anyone can submit via RFC (Request for Comments)
2. **Discussion**: 7-day minimum comment period
3. **Consensus**: Core Team seeks agreement, considers all feedback
4. **Decision**: Core Team makes final call if consensus not reached
5. **Appeal**: Any contributor can appeal to entire Core Team

=== Voting (when required)

**Quorum**: 50% + 1 of Core Team members
**Threshold**:
* Simple changes: Majority (50% + 1)
* Breaking changes: Supermajority (66% + 1)
* Governance changes: Supermajority (75% + 1)

**Veto Power**: Project Lead can veto, but must provide written justification

== RFC Process

All significant changes require an RFC:

1. **Draft**: Create `docs/rfcs/NNNN-title.adoc`
2. **Feedback**: 7-day comment period minimum
3. **Revision**: Author addresses feedback
4. **Decision**: Core Team accepts/rejects/defers
5. **Implementation**: Approved RFCs move to implementation

**Significant changes** include:
* Breaking API changes
* New major features
* Architectural shifts
* Dependency additions (>10MB or security-sensitive)

== Conflict Resolution

1. **Discussion**: Parties discuss directly
2. **Mediation**: Expert Contributor mediates
3. **Arbitration**: Core Team arbitrates
4. **Final Appeal**: Project Lead (rarely used)

**Code of Conduct violations** bypass this process → immediate enforcement.

== Financial Governance

=== Funding Allocation

Decisions on funding require Core Team approval:

| Category                | % of Total | Decision Authority |
|-------------------------|------------|--------------------|
| Maintainer Compensation | 40%        | Core Team          |
| Contributor Rewards     | 30%        | Expert + Core      |

=== Transparency

* Quarterly financial reports in `FUNDING_TRANSPARENCY.md`
* All expenses >$500 require public justification
* Annual audit (if budget >$50k/year)

== Succession Planning

=== Project Lead Succession

**Triggers**:
* Voluntary step-down
* 6+ months inactivity
* Core Team unanimous vote (only for severe CoC violations)

**Process**:
1. Core Team nominates candidates
2. 14-day community feedback period
3. Core Team votes (supermajority required)
4. Transition period: 30 days

=== Maintainer Succession

**Inactive Maintainer** (no activity for 12+ months):
* Status changed to "Emeritus"
* Write access retained (read-only until return)
* Core Team may appoint replacement

**Graceful Exit**:
* 30-day notice preferred
* Knowledge transfer to designated successor
* Emeritus status with recognition

== Amendment Process

This governance document can be amended:

1. **Proposal**: RFC with rationale
2. **Discussion**: 14-day minimum comment period
3. **Vote**: Core Team supermajority (75% + 1)
4. **Appeal Period**: 7 days for community appeals
5. **Ratification**: Merge governance amendment

**No amendments** that:
* Violate Code of Conduct principles
* Contradict AGPL-3.0 license
* Remove transparency requirements
